        <p>There's a lot of information about Perl out there on the World
          Wide Web. Unfortunately, a lot of it is of rather questionable
          quality. And, even more unfortunately, Google seems really happy
          to serve up results which include links to some of the dodgier
          pages - stuff that hasn't been updated since the end of the 90s.</p>
        <p>We could debate the reasons for this for days. But in my opinion
          this hurts Perl's reputation. This information reinforces the
          stereotype that Perl is still just the programming language that
          was used to write bad CGI scripts twenty years ago.</p>
        <p>So I've decided to do something about this.
          <a href="http://search.perlhacks.com/">Perl Search</a> is a
          <a href="https://www.google.com/cse/">Google Custom Search
          Engine</a> which returns results from sites that are known to
          have good and up to date information about Perl.</p>
